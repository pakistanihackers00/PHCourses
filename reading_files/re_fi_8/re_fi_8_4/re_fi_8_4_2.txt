SECOND METHOD OF FOR LOOP DECLARATION:
-------------------------------------
    [1]: In Second method we will declare for loop by two parameter 
         also we can use one paramete, And basically what are that 
         parameter is. If you see down below that example of for 
         loop, there we declare something like this: {1..5..1}, So, 
         This first portion which "1..5" its mean repeat 5 time time 
         and "..1" this last portion increment it by one.
