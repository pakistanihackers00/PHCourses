DEFAULT VARIABLE FOR READ:
--------------------------
    [1]: What will happen if we didn't declare variable for "read" keyword?
            |--> When we didn't declare any variable for read for saving some data
                 then Shell Script alread made a variable, which name is "REPLY",
                 Shell Script Save it by default in that variable.
