 How to run this on LINUX OS:
 
 First go to the directory where you download it. In my case I download it in "Downloads".
 So, I will go the Downloads folder first then I will Run these below commands:
 
 root@myuser: cd Downloads
 root@myuser: chmod -R +x PHcourses
 root@myuser: cd PHcourses/bash_course
 root@myuser: ./fullcourse.sh
