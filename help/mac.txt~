 How to run this on LINUX OS:
 
 First go to the directory where you download it. In my case I download it in "Downloads".
 So, I will go the Downloads folder first then I will Run these below commands:
 
 root@mymac% cd Downloads
 root@mymac% chmod -R 755 courses-PH
 root@mymac% cd courses-PH/bash_Course/
 root@mymac% ./fullcourse.sh
